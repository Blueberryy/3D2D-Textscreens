##### This addon can be installed via the [Steam Workshop for Garry's Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109643223) - I do not recommend manually installing this addon via git.

###### Features: 
* Create 3D2D text anywhere in the world 
* Rotate and manipulate this text simply via your physgun 
* Up to 5 lines of text 
* Multiple different fonts, font sizes, and colours
* Heavily optimised
  * Full scale testing on a highly popular RP server 
  * Draw distance optimisations 
  * Minimal FPS hit
* Permanent text screens
  * Hold C for context menu, right click on the textscreen, and make the text screen permanent (only works for admins). This is perfect for welcome messages or rules.
* Presets
  * Define preset textscreen data (size, text, colours, etc) and save/load these for future use at any time. This is very useful to trying to replicate multiple textscreens across maps.


###### Server owners:
* `sbox_maxtextscreens` controls the maximum amount of text screens that each player can spawn. This defaults to 1. This cvar only exists on the server, so make sure it's set via RCON, or in something like server.cfg.
* Set `ss_call_to_home 1` on your server to provide anonymous analytics including your operating system, version of the addon, and rough, anonymised geo-location. This is entirely optional and used solely to put a smile on my face.
* To install this onto your server, follow the instructions [listed here](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers).
